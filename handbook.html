<h1>The Handbook</h1>

<br><br><h2>What is this site all about?</h2>

<p><b>Short answer:</b> It's a place to debate stuff.
</p>

<p><b>Longer answer:</b> It's a social media experiment.
    Social media is known to create "echo chambers" where people form communities that validate each others' bad ideas.
    Many people believe social media has been destructive for the overall intelligence of humanity.
    But are there communities of people who care about what is true more than being validated?
    What if there was a site for those people?
    What if this site was designed to promote skepticism and critical thinking?
    Could it leverage diverse social interactions for good instead of evil?
    Could it promote content that was able to withstand scrutiny instead of content that made people feel validated?
    Would this site give intellectually minded people a place to share and pursue knowledge?
    Would it offer a more productive way for nerds to get some of that sweet social-media dopamine?
    Well, we wanted to know, so we built this site!
</p>

<br><br><h2>Debating Tips</h2>

<h3>(1) Think long-term:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The best way to win a debate is to be right.</li>
    <li>The best way to be right is to be knowledgeable.</li>
    <li>The best way to gain knowledge is to expose places where you are wrong and fix it.</li>
    <li>So focus on trying to see how your opponent can be right.</li>
    <li>And try to see how you can be wrong.</li>
</ul>

    <menu>
        <h3>"Sure, that's great for the long-term, but I want to win this debate right now, even if I'm wrong.
            Got any tips to help me with that?"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>No.</li>
            <li>Your goal is stupid.</li>
            <li>Get a better goal.</li>
        </ul>
    </menu>

<h3>(2) Always find something valid to explicitly acknowledge:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It looks strong when you form a habit of acknowledging some component of validity in your opponents comment before rebutting the remainder.</li>
    <li>It looks weak when you start by immediately pushing back.
        That comes across as if you are at the end of your arguments and you absolutely have to win this point.</li>
    <li>When people feel their points have been understood, they are more likely to listen to yours.</li>
    <li>Even if your opponent never reciprocates, you have set a better example.</li>
</ul>

    <menu>
        <h3>"But what if my opponent makes no valid points?"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh, come on! That really says more about you than your opponent.</li>
            <li>Look harder.</li>
            <li>If you are really spending your time debating a complete idiot, who is bahaving the most out of character?</li>
        </ul>
        <center><img src="slapping_monkey.jpg"></center>
    </menu>

<h3>(3) Take the time to be understanding:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Understanding people learn more.</li>
    <li>Even smart people were once ignorant.</li>
    <li>People who listen make a bigger impact.</li>
    <li>Your expressions probably aren't as well-articulated as you imagine. You need people to be understanding too.</li>
    <li>We're all in this together. So at least be nice.</li>
</ul>

    <menu>
        <h3>"How can I be understanding of blatant ignorance?"</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Let it be. Don't feed the trolls. If you don't have anything nice to say,
                don't say anything at all. Etc.</li>
            <li>Reducing your opponent to absurdity is the same as a victory.
                So accept your victory with grace.
                Just thank your opponent and disappear.</li>
            <li>Sometimes the strongest rebuttal is to leave a stupid argument hanging there
                to represent the person who posted it. "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Res_ipsa_loquitur">Res ipsa loquitur</a>".
                Any response you might give would only soften that critical blow against your opponent.</li>
        </ul>

<br><br><h2>Q and A about the rating/filtering system</h2>
<ol>
    <li><b>How should I rate fallacies not listed in the chart of logical fallacies?</b><br>
        <p>
            Don't rate them at all. Discuss them!
            We're not trying to preempt all discussion by having a categorization for every possible mistake.
            These are just the most common ones that tend to sabotage communication.
            If you encounter another fallacy, just kindly tell the other person about it.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>How should I rate comments that take no position at all, such as clarifying questions, compliments, greetings, or funny quips?</b><br>
        <p>
            The purpose of rating is to help people find arguments that interest them.
            So there is no need to rate compliments or greetings that are really only intended for a specific person anyway.
            For clarifying question that help to advance a discussion, "Reasonable" would probably be a suitable rating.
            If you like funny quips, rate them "Interesting".
            If you don't, "Impolite" or "Unclear relevance" might be more appropriate.
            You decide. As long as you are somewhat consistent, your ratings are helpful.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>What about lies, deception, blatant dishonesty, fake news, etc.?</b><br>
        <p>
            Smearing opponents is clearly impolite.
            If it is inaccurate, it falls under straw man too.
            And if it comes without credible evidence, that's also preaching and leaping.
            If it is baseless and inflammatory, that's dumping.
            So check all the boxes that apply.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Is there a way for people to find out who rated their arguments?</b><br>
        <p>
            No. (Well, technically I suppose a highly-determined person could hire a skilled
            hacker to plant a keystroke sniffer on your computer, or something crazy like that.
            But we provide no mechanism for exposing who rated what.)
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Is it okay to rate someone's comment "impolite" just because they have an offensive profile picture?</b><br>
        <p>
            Yes. Your negative ratings will spare people who rate the way you do (and who have the A.I. turned on) from seeing those posts.
            And people who rate differently from you will hardly be affected.
            So you should rate however you want to!
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>Doesn't the A.I. promote echo-chambers?</b><br>
        <p>
            Yes, it does promote echo-chambers for dogmatic people who let their biases influence their ratings,
            but it can actually reduce bias for people who moderate objectively.
            As an example, consider how science relies on peer review, rather than random person review.
            Turning to peer experts instead of random people is a very productive bias.
            Why? Because experts have a culture of being objective and critical.
            By contrast, random people would not even know how to find legitimate objections to a scientist's work.
            Sometimes, scientists are accused of living in echo chambers
            because they only entertain criticism from other experts who already accept with their core beliefs.
            Yet, they actually find fewer legitimate objections when they consult the general public.
        </p>

        <p>
            Similarly, the purpose of the A.I. is to help debaters to find intelligent arguments that challenge their own beliefs.
            But it only works for people who moderate objectively.
            People who let their biases influence their ratings will indeed create counter-productive own echo chambers.
            If turning the A.I. off seems to improve the quality of the arguments you see,
            that's a sign that have created an echo chamber for yourself.
            If that occurs, you should probably consider resetting your profile.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>I made a brilliant response to a stupid remark. Yet, it seems like no one is seeing my witty retort. What's the deal?</b><br>
        <p>
            Responses are not shown until people lower their thresholds enough to see the original comment too.
            And that's deliberate.
        </p>

        <p>
            We know it's lots of fun to bash people who make poor comments, but that's not what this site is about.
            We promote debates that are strong on both sides.
            So no, we are never going to start highlighting great responses to stupid comments.
            If you want to be heard, spend your time responding to intelligent comments, and stop wasting time on the easy ones.
        </p>

        <p>
            Incidentally, this means if you rate your opponents badly, you are implicitly burying your own responses.
            That's also deliberate.
            Our system is calculated to promote intelligent and respectful debate.
            Deal with it.
        </p>
    </li>

    <li><b>That moderation system seems rather complex. Is that really necessary?</b><br>
        <p>
            That's the whole point of this site.
            If it turns off people who prefer not to think deeply, then it is working precisely as intended.
        </p>
