        <br><br><h2>What is this site all about?</h2>

        <p><b>Short answer:</b> It's a place to debate stuff.
        </p>

        <p><b>Longer answer:</b> It's a social media experiment.
            Social media is known to create "echo chambers" where people form communities that validate each others' bad ideas.
            Many people believe social media has been destructive for the overall intelligence of humanity.
            But are there communities of people who care about what is true more than being validated?
            What if there was a site for those people?
            What if this site was designed to promote skepticism and critical thinking?
            Could it leverage diverse social interactions for good instead of evil?
            Could it promote content that was able to withstand scrutiny instead of content that made people feel validated?
            Would this site give intellectually minded people a place to share and pursue knowledge?
            Would it offer a more productive way for nerds to get some of that sweet social-media dopamine?
            Well, we wanted to know, so we built this site!

            <li>The best way to be right is to be knowledgeable.</li>
            <li>The best way to gain knowledge is to expose places where you are wrong and fix it.</li>

        <br><br><h2>Q and A about the rating/filtering system</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><b>How should I rate fallacies not listed in the chart of logical fallacies?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Don't rate them at all. Discuss them!
                    We're not trying to preempt all discussion by having a categorization for every possible mistake.
                    These are just the most common ones that tend to sabotage communication.
                    If you encounter another fallacy, just kindly tell the other person about it.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>How should I rate comments that take no position at all, such as clarifying questions, compliments, greetings, or funny quips?</b><br>
                <p>
                    The purpose of rating is to help people find arguments that interest them.
                    So there is no need to rate compliments or greetings that are really only intended for a specific person anyway.
                    For clarifying question that help to advance a discussion, "Reasonable" would probably be a suitable rating.
                    If you like funny quips, rate them "Interesting".
                    If you don't, "Impolite" or "Unclear relevance" might be more appropriate.
                    You decide. As long as you are somewhat consistent, your ratings are helpful.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>What about lies, deception, blatant dishonesty, fake news, etc.?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Smearing opponents is clearly impolite.
                    If it is inaccurate, it falls under straw man too.
                    And if it comes without credible evidence, that's also preaching and leaping.
                    If it is baseless and inflammatory, that's dumping.
                    So check all the boxes that apply.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Is there a way for people to find out who rated their arguments?</b><br>
                <p>
                    No. (Well, technically I suppose a highly-determined person could hire a skilled
                    hacker to plant a keystroke sniffer on your computer, or something crazy like that.
                    But we provide no mechanism for exposing who rated what.)
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Is it okay to rate someone's comment "impolite" just because they have an offensive profile picture?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Yes. Your negative ratings will spare people who rate the way you do (and who have the A.I. turned on) from seeing those posts.
                    And people who rate differently from you will hardly be affected.
                    So you should rate however you want to!
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>Doesn't the A.I. promote echo-chambers?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Yes, it does promote echo-chambers for dogmatic people who let their biases influence their ratings,
                    but it can actually reduce bias for people who moderate objectively.
                    As an example, consider how science relies on peer review, rather than random person review.
                    Turning to peer experts instead of random people is a very productive bias.
                    Why? Because experts have a culture of being objective and critical.
                    By contrast, random people would not even know how to find legitimate objections to a scientist's work.
                    Sometimes, scientists are accused of living in echo chambers
                    because they only entertain criticism from other experts who already accept with their core beliefs.
                    Yet, they actually find fewer legitimate objections when they consult the general public.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Similarly, the purpose of the A.I. is to help debaters to find intelligent arguments that challenge their own beliefs.
                    But it only works for people who moderate objectively.
                    People who let their biases influence their ratings will indeed create counter-productive own echo chambers.
                    If turning the A.I. off seems to improve the quality of the arguments you see,
                    that's a sign that have created an echo chamber for yourself.
                    If that occurs, you should probably consider resetting your profile.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li><b>I made a brilliant response to a stupid remark. Yet, it seems like no one is seeing my witty retort. What's the deal?</b><br>
                <p>
                    Responses are not shown until people lower their thresholds enough to see the original comment too.
                    And that's deliberate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We know it's lots of fun to bash people who make poor comments, but that's not what this site is about.
                    We promote debates that are strong on both sides.
                    So no, we are never going to start highlighting great responses to stupid comments.
                    If you want to be heard, spend your time responding to intelligent comments, and stop wasting time on the easy ones.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Incidentally, this means if you rate your opponents badly, you are implicitly burying your own responses.
                    That's also deliberate.
                    Our system is calculated to promote intelligent and respectful debate.
                    Deal with it.
                </p>

            <li><b>That moderation system seems rather complex. Is that really necessary?</b><br>
                <p>
                    That's the whole point of this site.
                    If it turns off people who prefer not to think deeply, then it is working precisely as intended.
                </p>
